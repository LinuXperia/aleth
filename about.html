<title>Aleth</title>
<div id="placeholder">
  <p><a href="https://aleth.eu">Aleth</a> is a simple flashcard application made by <a href="https://thomash.fr">Thomas HUET</a>.</p>
  <p>
    Aleth allows you to create flashcards to help you remember anything you want.
    Create a new card whenever you learn something new and Aleth will make sure you never forget it.
    <br>
    You should review your cards every day (it's OK to skip a day but it means you'll have more cards to review the next day).
    Reviewing cards usually takes only a few minutes per day.
    <br>
    Aleth was designed to be used as described in <a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html">this (rather long) essay</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Aleth's focus is on simplicity.
    If you would like more features such as creating separate decks and sharing them, I recommend you try <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net">Anki</a> which has a large number of <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/">premade decks</a> for a wide variety of topics.
